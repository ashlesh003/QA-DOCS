            "Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well, capturing noise and irrelevant patterns, leading to poor generalization on unseen data. Underfitting, on the other hand, happens when the model is too simple to capture the underlying structure of the data. Techniques for handling imbalanced datasets in machine learning include resampling and cross-validation. The bias -variance tradeoff refers to the balance between bias and variance in predictive models. High bias can cause underfitting, while high variance can lead to overfitting. It's crucial to find a balance to minimize both errors.\n"
